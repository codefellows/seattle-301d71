# Node, npm, and Express

## Overview

Today we will take a step into the back end, beginning to write a proper `server.js` file to serve API data to the City Explorer client application. You will continue to build out this file through lab 9, working with a new partner each day.

Another component of this portion of the course involves working with a static client which you have no control over. You will be able to view the source code for this client, but will not be permitted to modify it in anyway. Servers and clients are separate entities; the only relationships that exist between them are the relationships we create. This week, you will be creating those relationships.
