# Server-side templating with EJS

## Overview

Today is the first day of our new project, a mobile-only book collection. You will be working with the same partner(s) each day, gradually working towards a full-scale application, complete with server-side templating, persistence in a SQL database, and the ability to search the Google Books API for new books to add to your collection.

## Weekly Feedback Review

- There are a lot of tasks to complete each day
- On Monday I was scared of the back-end, it was not so scary after all
- Why do we have a retro every day
- Discussing career assignments in class
- Will we cover other dev environments like docker

## Daily Plan

- Warm-up exercise
- Review code challenges
- Introduction of today's code challenge topic
- Full-stack application skeleton scaffolding
- HTML5 Forms
- Server-side templating
- Google Books API
- Code Demo
- Lab Preview

## Learning Objectives

As a result of completing lecture 11 of Code 301, students will:
- Understand how to architect a full-stack web application 
- Create a schema to model data
- Interact with the Google Books API to search for books based on user queries
