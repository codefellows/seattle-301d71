# Code 301: Intermediate Software Development

Welcome to Code 301! This class builds on your 201 foundation with a deep dive into the world of servers. Using jQuery, Node.js, npm libraries, flexbox and grid, this class prepares you for 401.

## Overview

Code 301 begins with front end development using jQuery, flexbox, and grid. Module 2 is entirely dedicated to the back end and building a server to serve files to an already made front end site. Module 3 brings everything together with the development of a full-stack application from start to finish. The final module is team-based project work.

## General Daily Plan

- Warm-up exercise
- Review code challenges and whiteboarding
- Introduction of today's code challenge topic
- Code review of lab assignment
- Code demo of new topics
- Lab preview
- Code challenge implementation
- Collaborative lab time

## Learning Objectives

As a result of completing Code 301, students will:

- Collaboratively design and create web applications from scratch using MVC architecture built with professional-grade HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- Work with string, array, and object data structures and algorithms to solve code challenges with pure JavaScript programming.
- Design dynamic front end and back end applications which can function together or independently and are deployed to cloud platforms.
- Explain the fundamentals of how the World Wide Web works, over the internet.
- Utilize dependency management techniques to build with third-party libraries such as ExpressJS, jQuery, EJS, and Mustache.
- Persist one-to-many relational data across multiple tables in a SQL database, sourced from third-party API or user-generated content.
- Follow agile software development practices during week-long sprints, including pair-programming, stand-ups, daily retrospectives, project management with Kanban boards, regular refactoring, and working in a shared code base.
- Enroll in a Code 401 course or attain an entry-level website development job or internship by completing the course requirements.
